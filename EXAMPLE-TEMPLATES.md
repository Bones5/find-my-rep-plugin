## Tips for Writing Effective Letters

### Do:
- Be specific about the issue
- Explain how it affects you and your community
- Be polite and respectful
- Include clear requests or actions you want taken
- Keep it concise (aim for 200-300 words)
- Provide facts and evidence where relevant

### Don't:
- Use aggressive or threatening language
- Make it too long (avoid essays)
- Include personal attacks
- Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Copy-paste without personalization
- Send the same exact letter too frequently

### Placeholders

The plugin supports two placeholders:
- `{{representative_name}}` - Will be replaced with the representative's full name
- `{{representative_title}}` - Will be replaced with the representative's title (e.g., "Member of Parliament")

These placeholders ensure each letter is personalized for the recipient.

### Customization

Users will be able to edit the letter before sending, so:
- Provide a solid structure and framework
- Include helpful prompts in square brackets [like this]
- Make it easy for users to add their personal story
- Balance between guidance and flexibility

### Testing Your Template

Before deploying a template:
1. Test with different representative types (MP, MS, Councillor, PCC)
2. Check that placeholders work correctly
3. Read it aloud to ensure it sounds natural
4. Have someone else review for clarity
5. Ensure it's suitable for multiple issues/topics if it's a general template
