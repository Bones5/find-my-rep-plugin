- Returns representative data to frontend

#### `find_my_rep_send_letter`
- Accepts sender info, letter content, and selected representatives
- Personalizes letter for each representative

- Returns success/error status

### 6. Email Integration
- Uses Resend API for email delivery
- Personalizes each letter with representative's name and title

### 8. Build System
- Uses `@wordpress/scripts` for building
- Webpack-based build process
- Proper script and style bundling
- Asset file generation for dependencies

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures

1. **Nonce Verification**: All AJAX requests verify WordPress nonces
2. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
   - `sanitize_text_field()` for text inputs
   - `sanitize_email()` for email addresses
   - `sanitize_textarea_field()` for letter content
3. **Output Escaping**: All output is escaped
   - `esc_html()` for text
   - `esc_attr()` for attributes
   - `esc_textarea()` for textarea content
4. **Capability Checks**: Admin settings restricted to users with `manage_options` capability
5. **AJAX Access Control**: Both logged-in and public access supported via proper hooks
6. **Direct Access Prevention**: Exit if `ABSPATH` not defined
7. **CodeQL Analysis**: No security vulnerabilities detected
8. **Dependency Check**: No known vulnerabilities in npm packages

### Potential Considerations for Production

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on AJAX endpoints
2. **Email Validation**: The Resend API validates sending domains; ensure proper domain verification
3. **Postcode Validation**: Additional server-side postcode format validation could be added
4. **Letter Content Filtering**: Consider adding content filtering to prevent spam/abuse
5. **CORS Configuration**: Ensure API endpoints have proper CORS headers if hosted separately

## API Integration

The plugin requires an external API that:
- Accepts GET requests with a `postcode` parameter
- Returns JSON array of representative objects
- Each object should contain: `name`, `email`, and optionally `title` and `type`

See `API-INTEGRATION.md` for detailed integration guide with examples.

## Resend Configuration

The plugin uses Resend for email delivery:
1. Create account at https://resend.com
2. Verify your sending domain
3. Generate API key
4. Configure key in WordPress admin

## Installation & Usage

1. Upload plugin to `/wp-content/plugins/find-my-rep-plugin/`
2. Activate via WordPress admin
3. Configure settings under Settings > Find My Rep
4. Add block to any page/post via block editor

### For End Users

1. Enter postcode
